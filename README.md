# AlpacaControll

## (A) Arch (L) Linux (pac) Package Repo Control

A Simple Arch Linux Package Repo Tool That auto-compiles Packages on change, Supports different Architectures and makes creating Packages easier in a TUI built with ratatui in Rust. At Least this is the Goal of the Project

### Preview

No Working Code yet but this is how the TUI should look like.

## What

### Status
The Status Shows what actions like Buidlding or testing are running and if the Folders are setup correctly

### Todo/Unupdated
Shows which Packages are unupdated and if they get Updated which version gets to the Repo and which is currently there

### Progress 
Shows how far the Diffrent Jobs mainly Building Jobs are in an Progressbar

### Help/Keybinds
Shows the most used Keybinds and has an clickable action menu in which the Actions can be executed

### Repoinformation
Shows information about the Repo like when it got last updated and Name 

## Command Line Arguments
### Version 
shows the Version of the Programm

### Config 
Shows if the Configuration was Parsed without Error and what arguments got Parsed

### Path
Path to directory to not have to CD into it

### Config Path
Path to the Global config File

## Config Format 

### Project Config
The Config will be an arepo.toml file located in the Workspace of all two/three folders  
These are Project specific Configurations that aren't supposed to be changed Manually but are important for the Programm  
When setting up the Project it will be autogenerated

### Programm Config 
Example Config.toml will be placed in ~/.config/Alpaca-controll/ and contains some Configs like an PGP Key that can be attributed to specific Config and other Things

### Repo File 
The repo.toml file has some informations as Version numbers of the Packages stored so i don't have to fetch them everytime

# Explorer Page
## Why
Gives the Ability to change the Repository without closing the Programm

## How
Gives selection from Known Repos stored in global Config and ability to search for Folder 
# Setup Page

## The Setup Page guids you througth the Setup of an Repo and the Personal config

### Page
The Tui Will have a colored Checklist of what is already done and what isn't. Some things will be greyd out if then can't be done now as they require something  
There is also an Prograss bar which will display the overall Progress  
There is also an Part that Shows the Current Config

### What to do
- Generate GPG Key
- Make File Structure
- Make Config
- Add VCS
- Generate most importan Packages if needed (Keyring, Mirrorlist)

### When
The Page is only reachable if Parsing the Config throws an error or the checks if everything is setup Fail

# How

## Probable Concept

This is how it Could work but it might Change during the Implementation as i have no Idea how good it might Work and how some Concepts Work as it is my first GUI/TUI App and the first Big rust Programm in general

### Blocks

#### Render Loop
The Render Loops gets data from the App State and Determines based on Data Like What i am currently Doing and then gets diffrent Layouts based on that in which Things like Progressbars also get the Data

The Render Loop runs at certain Tickspeed depending on what is Configured and runs always at that Speed as everything that might take Time is run on the Event Loop or as a Thread

#### App State
The App State is the State of the Application. It is the Data that is used to Render the TUI. It can only be Changed from the Event Loop

#### Event Loop
The Event Loop is the Loop which handles Keypresses and starts Jobs via Threadpool with a certain max Threads mose usefull for package Building

If the Event Loop runs slow the data doesn't change but the Render Loop will still run at the same speed and show certain Things Smooth 

#### Threadpool
The Threadpool is the Pool of Threads that are used to run Jobs. It is limited to a certain Amount of Threads and if there are no Threads available it will wait until there is one available

#### Keybinds 
Keypresses are handled by the Eventloop and change the Event Loop

#### Jobs
Jobs are Functions run in seperate Threads that can send Messages to the Event Loop to change the App State like Update The Progress

#### App State ---> Render Loop  
The Render Loop gets the App State as an refrence but can't change it

#### Event Loop ---> App State
The Event Loop can change the App State via getting an mutable refrence to the App State

#### Keybinds ---> Event Loop
The Keybinds are Precessed by the Event Loop when an key is Pressed and change the App State via Event Loop

#### Event Loop ---> Threadpool
The Event Loop can start Jobs via the Threadpool by sending a message Which Job to Start

#### Threadpool ---> Jobs
The Threadpool start the Jobs and then don't interact with them anymore. It myght be combined with the Threadpool

#### Jobs ---> Event Loop
The Job can send Messages to the Event Loop which then can change for ex. The Layout or the Progress of an Progressbar

- Learning the ratatui Library for future Projects
- Learning GUI/TUI Programming Principles
- Learn how to efficiently Code
- Learn how to manage a Project

# I am getting close to the Last year of my apprenticeship as an Electrician so I don't Have much Time yet to build it.
